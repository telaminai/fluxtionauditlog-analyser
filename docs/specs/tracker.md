## Hardening — test-only, ongoing (no user-visible change)
- ☑ **Cross-transport schema contract** — REST `/manifest` and MCP `tools/list` are proven to advertise
  the *same* `VerbSchemas` schema per verb at the **value** level, not just matching name sets:
  `McpToolsTest` pins every tool's `inputSchema` == its verb schema minus the lifted `description`;
  `ManifestVerbContractTest` pins `/manifest`'s `schemas` field == `VerbSchemas.all()` verbatim. The two
  transports can no longer fork a verb's parameters.
- ◧ **Formula golden fixtures** — a hand-derived expected-series corpus for the Expr engine, grown
  **without code** (`graph/FormulaGoldenTest` + `src/test/resources/formula-golden/*.golden`). First
  tranche: LOCF/STRICT/two-arg-if/NaN + rolling `mean` fill-before-speak / `lag` / `delta`. The rule
  (derive from intended semantics, **never snapshot output**) and the TODO taxonomy — `rate()`
  span-normalisation first, the c3094ea bug class — are in
  **[spec-formula-golden-fixtures.md](spec-formula-golden-fixtures.md)**.
  Review endorsed (all 7 re-derived correct — `completed/review_formula_golden_fixtures.txt`). **G1 and G2
  closed** (58879d7): an empty `EXPECT` now requires a declared `expectEmpty: true`, and every
  fixture runs through BOTH engine arms — `SeriesExtractor.extractExpr` *and* `SeriesScan` — with
  agreement asserted. Closing G2 immediately caught the `series` verb answering from stale carries
  (the 1.5.0 headline fix): the corpus's first scalp, on the day the cross-path check landed.
  Still open: **N1** (duplicate metadata key assertion — a doubled `expr:` line silently takes the
  last), plus one taxonomy add: a `min(4, 2)` / clamp-idiom fixture pinning the M28 compatibility
  guarantee.

## M13 · MCP transport — ◧ M13.1–13.4 SHIPPED (archived; M13.5 open)
_M13.1–13.4 (endpoint file, bridge, tools/call forward, docs) shipped 2026-08-15,
reviewed and merged — full record in **[completed/tracker.md](completed/tracker.md)**.
Design: **[spec-assistant-actions-mcp.md](spec-assistant-actions-mcp.md)** (stays live for
M13.5). Review decisions: hand-rolled JSON-RPC kept over an SDK; `structuredContent` parked
with M13.5._
- [M13.5] ☐ _(later)_ **Resources/prompts** (`analyser://log|selection|node-types|source`) and/or **option B**
  in-app Streamable-HTTP MCP server.

## M12 · Diagnose → fix → prove flywheel — ☐ ACTIVE DESIGN
_Design: **[spec-closed-loop.md](spec-closed-loop.md)** Part A (the handoff mechanics) and
**[completed/spec-assistant-actions.md](completed/spec-assistant-actions.md)** §13 (the original
diagnose → fix → prove framing). The edit loop lives in the dev env (Claude Code / Codex + CI),
**not** the analyser — the analyser's role is the **briefing and verification instrument**._
- [M12.1] ☐ **`export_finding` action** — emit the **fix-brief** (structure in spec-assistant-actions
  §13.1): diagnosis, evidence (records + byte anchors + file-access seeding), resolved source targets
  (`instanceId → file:line`, EP FQN, roots), replay reference, task, and acceptance (replay-diff: only
  the targeted records change). Built on `PromptBuilder`. **Precondition:** journal ↔ audit-log pairing
  (the analyser loads the output log, not the input journal).
- _Decision (2026-08-16): **the analyser prompt distils Fluxtion semantics; the fix brief carries the
  authoring rules**. The assistant reads logs, so it gets the reading-relevant subset (propagation/dirty,
  audit regimes, wiring-by-constructor) plus a fetch-on-demand pointer — not `claude.txt` inline, which is
  ~30KB of authoring guidance per request and invites answering the wrong question. **M12.4's brief is
  where the full authoring rules belong**, since that agent edits code; M19.1's bundle already plans the
  same via its `CLAUDE.md` bootstrap._
- [M12.4] ☐ **"Fix with agent…" handoff launcher** _(spec-closed-loop §A)_ — writes the brief to
  `<sourceRoot>/.analyser/fix-brief-<ts>.md` **plus `.analyser/.gitignore` (`fix-brief-*` — scoped so
  M20's committed project profile in the same dir isn't ignored) so briefs can never be committed**; v1 copies a ready-to-paste launch command (presets for Claude Code / Codex; template
  placeholders `{brief}` `{sourceRoot}` `{logPath}` — **no token in the command**: the agent reads the
  rotating endpoint+token from M13.1's `~/.fluxtion-analyser/rest-endpoint`). Every brief embeds the
  **git-hygiene contract** (branch, evidence-linked PR, never merge autonomously, prove by replay
  test) — the brief *instructs*; enforcement is the user's branch protection + PR review. _Accept:
  paste one command → agent opens holding the brief, works on a branch, PRs with evidence cited._
- [M12.2] ☐ **`export_test_fixture`** — record range → regression test oracle: a journaled slice driven
  through the processor / one node asserting its `nodeLogs`. Production incidents → real-sequence
  **red tests** the fixing agent turns green.
- [M12.3] ☐ **`DiffBuilder` additive-vs-value classification** — report new `nodeLogs` keys separately
  from changed values, so an instrumentation-only change shows as **pure-additive** (a verifiable property).
- _Out of scope (dev-env / Telamin): the LLM fix itself; replay-diff + unit tests as **mandatory CI
  gates**; **AOT regeneration** when an edit adds a handler/node; guardrail **propose → prove → human
  approves, never autonomous merge** (review the diff of **behaviour**, not just code)._

## M18 · Mongoose server link — ☒ **CLOSED 2026-08-22 in favour of the agent-brokered dev loop**
_Superseded by **[spec-agent-brokered-dev-loop.md](spec-agent-brokered-dev-loop.md)** (ACCEPTED v2),
assessed in [review_spec_agent_brokered_dev_loop.txt](../handoff/completed/review_spec_agent_brokered_dev_loop.txt).
The deciding argument is no longer between two specs: **M34.0 passed its gate and M34.1's ordering
slice shipped**, so M18 as specced would contradict merged code — the analyser cannot be made
engine-agnostic and taught one server's REST API in the same quarter._

_**Closed as "not the analyser's questions"** (acceptance 5): **M18.1** link/status · **M18.3**
audit level · **M18.3a** the missing `GET` companion · **M18.4** dev restart · **M18.4a** why
`start`/`stop` are commented out · **M18.6** source+graphml over REST · **O3** admin auth. They move
to a Mongoose-side MCP tool, in the repo whose release cadence owns them._

- [M18.2] ⏸ **PARKED, not deleted** — log discovery (*point the analyser at your running system*).
  **Revival trigger, stated so it is falsifiable:** revive as an onboarding affordance only if
  evidence shows no-agent developers bouncing off the export step. Until then the agent exports and
  calls `open {log}`, which shipped.
- [M18.5] ☐ _(unchanged, still deferred)_ deploy-jar-and-restart; non-loopback/production posture.
  Now the natural home of **D-B7's paid production MCP** — enforcement server-side, since a licence
  check inside a source-available client is an `if` anyone can delete.
- **O5 — RESOLVED 2026-08-22 and CLOSED** (spec §G). Under M18 the overlap with `svc-admin-web`'s
  audit viewer was a positioning problem settled by assertion. Under the adopted design it is
  structural: the server's viewer is the **live, in-situ, one-server** surface; the analyser is the
  **deep** one, fed by exports and adapters across many logs and systems. They are not fed by the
  same thing, so they do not compete.
- **Before any cross-repo work starts:** the loop is a contract and gets a **conformance harness**
  (spec §H) — a scripted end-to-end of steps 3–7, homed in the **M19 bench**, so a break fails in the
  owning repo rather than in a user's session. The three-repo dependency is acceptable *because* of
  this and not otherwise.

## M19 · Onboarding example — playground download → running Mongoose → analyser — ☐ PROPOSED
_Design: **[spec-onboarding-example.md](spec-onboarding-example.md)**. The playground's Download button
ships a runnable Mongoose example with audit logging pre-enabled (file sink at a predictable path),
bundled source, and a **project profile at `.analyser/project.fluxtion-settings`** (M20's canonical path —
the bundle *is* a project profile) — so onboarding becomes: download → run → jbang the analyser →
project auto-loads (M20; **File ▸ Import** until it lands) → Follow a live log with click-to-source and Explain working.
Target: under 10 minutes on a fresh machine with only a JDK. The bundle's README links back to the
analyser (reverse funnel)._
- [M19] ➜ **REVISED 2026-08-29** — `spec-onboarding-example.md` ▸ *Revision 2026-08-29*. Owner-directed:
  one download should produce a project where an LLM already knows Fluxtion, is connected to the analyser
  over MCP, and is told by the analyser which skills run/stop/read the local app. The spec pre-dated M38,
  M42 and M43, so five additions: **R1** the bundle ships `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md`; **R2** the shipped
  profile REGISTERS them as `runbook.N.*` (and states why that does not violate D-AI5 — a bundle author
  declaring their own runbooks is the author declaring, not the analyser inferring); **R3** MCP
  pre-wiring, and step 6's division-of-labour paragraph is now WRONG and rewritten (M42 made it one agent
  that both edits and drives; the surviving principle is that the ANALYSER edits no code); **R4** the
  licence key is the first wall after first success and the seeded CLAUDE.md must pre-empt it; **R5** open
  the analyser on the GRAPH before the first run, so M40.1 has something true to say at minute two.
- [D-R1] ☐ **Owner: should the analyser manage the Fluxtion API key?** Recommendation in the spec —
  yes, but it WRITES `~/.fluxtion/fluxtion.apiKeyFile` and never HOLDS the value; presence/absence is the
  only fact it keeps. M42's "never edit another tool's config" does not apply (`~/.fluxtion/` is
  Fluxtion's own, and this app already owns `~/.fluxtion-analyser/rest-endpoint`), but the no-credentials
  posture does: the value must never reach `context`, an echo, the profile, share export or a screenshot —
  the sweep cannot see inside a PNG. Reuse `fluxtion-visualiser`'s file format rather than re-deriving it.
- [D-R2] ☐ **Owner: who authors the shipped skills** — bundle-side (they are Mongoose operations) with
  the analyser's docs owning only the shape. Confirm the split.
- [M19.1] ☐ **Bundle contract (playground-side)** — **full Maven project** (O1 resolved: user edits
  it in their IDE with their own LLM) with audit enabled + generated/EP source + settings file +
  **`CLAUDE.md` agent bootstrap** (the layered prompt stack in spec §Contract — thin example-specific
  layer, snapshot of the canon at generation time, canonical-reference line) + admin REST on + README
  with run command and analyser link; tracked in the playground repo, contract recorded in the spec.
  _**The authoring path is not a gap — use its front door.** It is already layered and maintained:
  [`/build-with-ai`](https://fluxtion-playground.dev/build-with-ai) →
  [`CLAUDE.md`](https://fluxtion-playground.dev/CLAUDE.md) (orientation) → `spring-authoring/skill.md`
  (how to run the design conversation) → `contract.md` (the exact `FluxtionSpringConfig` XML to emit) →
  `example.md` (a worked run) → the **project starter generates the build** — the pom is generated
  output, not something an author writes. Design work: `fluxtion-compiler/design/spring-authoring`.
  The bundle's job is to **reference and snapshot** that canon plus what only it knows (log path, admin
  port, the analyser's endpoint file), never to author a rival prompt. Add `skill.md`/`contract.md` to
  the snapshot set for the XML-defined example (spec O2), since those are what make the design-level
  edit in tutorial part 4 possible._
- [M19.1a] ◧ **Mongoose starter conformance bench (validation only; not a bundle shipment)** — the
  downloaded `mongoose-hosted-fluxtion` starter now has a reviewable contract snapshot in
  [`mongoose-bootstrap-artefacts/`](mongoose-bootstrap-artefacts/), with its source project retaining
  ownership. It tests this M19.1 contract **and** the accepted agent-brokered dev-loop where they meet:
  M19's native `./logs/audit-<name>.yaml`, profile and Follow/source evidence stay required; the
  registry/export/GraphML leg is **VAL-12**, exercised by `tools/bench/loop-bench.py` only when Mongoose
  supplies UP-MNG-01 and the export surface. The current starter supplies neither, so it makes no
  brokered-loop or distribution claim. Review resolution:
  [`report_mongoose_bootstrap_review_resolution.txt`](../handoff/report_mongoose_bootstrap_review_resolution.txt).
  V0 is documentation-complete except for owner decision D-02; V1 application work has not started.
  The project-local `.claude/skills/mongoose-local/SKILL.md` is discoverable-but-not-auto-added and is
  not the graduated shared skill (V5). Its local tracker carries the four explicit review follow-ups:
  A1 real-server bench, A2 registry-first discovery, A3 UP-MNG-02 disposition, and A4 manual skill
  adoption; none is complete merely because the documentation exists.
- [M19.2] ☑ **`SettingsShare`: resolve relative roots against the import file's parent** — `preview`
  gained a `baseDir` overload; import resolves bundle-relative source roots / Maven repos against the
  settings file's directory (absolute & `~`-paths untouched; clipboard imports pass no baseDir). 2 tests.
  Unblocks the tutorial's "zero manual setup" claim.
- [M19.3] ☐ **Tutorial page** `docs/site/tutorial-playground.md` — four parts (run+import ·
  analyse/tail · assistant · edit-with-your-IDE's-AI) + the 8-screenshot set (spec §Part 2, anonymised
  per policy), nav under Getting started. **Publish-gated on the bundle shipping** (write against the
  contract; publish only when Download delivers). **Two authoring notes:** (a) the pathway table names
  the Support leg "run, observe, diagnose *and fix*" — but "fix" is M12/M18; keep the page copy honest
  to what's shipped that week (don't promise fixing before M18 lands — the end-bridge already phases it
  as "+ server link once M18 ships"). (b) In-page links must be **site-relative** (`producing-a-log.md`,
  not the spec's `../site/producing-a-log.md`) or `mkdocs build --strict` fails the link-check.
- [M19.4] ☐ **Cross-links** — getting-started step 2, producing-a-log, landing "Get going"; **and the
  tutorial's end-bridge**: a closing "Do this on your own system →" section linking producing-a-log
  (+ the server link once M18 ships) — the demo must hand off to the user's real adoption, not stop at
  the toy.
- [M19.5] ☐ _(defer unless tutorial reads clunky)_ **File ▸ Open example…** one-action helper
  (import + open + Follow).
- [M19.6] ☑ **The loop's conformance bench — §H's home** _(DONE 2026-08-25, merged to main)_ —
  `tools/bench/loop-bench.py` plays the agent of dev-loop §C3 steps 3–7 (glob the registry → pick →
  export log + GraphML → `open {log, graphml, provenance}` + `source_root` → assert from `context` /
  `coverage` / `topology` that the loop closed), PASS/FAIL per step, non-zero exit on failure.
  `mongoose-stub.py` plays a server reduced to the contract (UP-MNG-01 registry file, mode 600; the export
  endpoints) from the in-tree demo set, so the bench runs today with no Mongoose — and pointed at a real
  `~/.mongoose/servers/` it is the acceptance test for UP-MNG-01/02. Assumptions (auth header, files
  listing shape) flagged in its README, not baked in.
- [M19.7] ☑ **An agent-driven fresh start** _(DONE 2026-08-25, merged to main; review_feat_m35_project N2)_
  — `analyser --rest` starts with the REST transport on (persisted, and stdout says so) and skips the
  first-run modal that otherwise blocked an agent on a never-configured machine before the socket existed;
  the MCP bridge's "not running" error names the command. Exercised by the bench's `--launch`, which
  starts a fresh install in an isolated home.
- [M19.8] ☐ **The bench in CI** — the analyser is Swing, so the job needs a display (`xvfb-run` on the
  Linux runner) plus the stub; not verified from a Mac, so recorded rather than claimed. Until then the
  bench is run locally before any of the three repos' loop code changes.
- [M19.9] ☐ **A headless test for the launch arguments** — `Main` now strips `--rest`, rejects an
  unknown flag AFTER stripping, and lets a log path fall through. That is pure logic with three
  behaviours and no unit test (rule 4). The loop bench covers it end-to-end, but only where a jar, a
  JVM and a window exist, so a headless CI run would not catch a regression. From
  `review_feat_m19_bench.txt` F3.
- Open: O2 which example — **tiebreaker: prefer Spring-XML-defined** (design-IR edit variant in the
  tutorial + the design→graph→record provenance chain; spec §Contract notes). _(O1: Maven project · O3: bundles generated at Download time, nothing to
  regenerate · O4: committed as M19.2 — all resolved.)_

## M21 · Topology view + step-through — ◧ CORE SHIPPED (archived; 21.7–21.9 open)
_M21.1–21.6 (parse, layout, panel, step-through, wiring, docs) and M21.10 (intra-record
cursor) shipped and reviewed — full record in **[completed/tracker.md](completed/tracker.md)**.
Design: **[completed/spec-graph-replay.md](completed/spec-graph-replay.md)**._
- [M21.7] ☐ _(later)_ server-sourced GraphML via `GET /api/processors/{group}/{name}/graphml` (needs M18.1).
- [M21.11] ☐ **Consume the declared trace flag** _(owner ask 2026-08-17; needs UP-FLX-11 upstream)_ —
  when the record header carries `trace: true|false` (per record — the level is runtime-gated, one
  file can hold both regimes), prefer the declaration over `AuditTrace.tracesEveryInvocation` and keep
  the heuristic only for legacy logs. Classification language shifts from inference to declared fact:
  `trace:true` → absence drawn as DID NOT RUN with certainty; `trace:false` → absence drawn as a
  potentially missing step; the empty-cycle case (unclassifiable today) resolves. Small: parser reads
  one header key; `AuditTrace` gains a declared-first path; topology legend wording updates.
- [M21.9] ☐ **Use `ProcessorDescriptor` instead of inferring** _(found 2026-08-16 reading a generated
  processor)_ — AOT processors carry a self-description: `inputs()` (name + FQN of every accepted event),
  `sinks()`, `services()`, plus `graphmlResource()`, `sourceFingerprint()` and `toolchainVersion()`.
  Two of those would replace guesswork outright:
  **`graphmlResource()`** is "the classpath resource name of the graphml sidecar describing this
  processor's topology" → auto-resolve the topology instead of *Open .graphml…*;
  **`sourceFingerprint()`** is "a fingerprint of the source graph… the cache/staleness key" → exact build
  pairing instead of `Match` inferring it from instanceIds.
  **Blocked, not ready:** verified on two independently generated processors that `Meta` is emitted as
  `(null, null, null, null)` — the contract exists, the values are unrecorded. `inputs()`/`services()`
  *are* populated and could sharpen `EntryPointResolver`, though the graphml's EVENT/EXPORTSERVICE nodes
  already carry equivalent information. **Next step is an ask upstream** (populate `Meta`), not code here.
- [M21.8] ☐ _(later)_ **node → flag** — "flag every record where node X fired" needs an `instanceId`
  lookup in `LogIndex`; flags are per-record and no such index exists, so M21.5 shipped filter-to-node
  (existing free-text scan) instead. Index work, not wiring.
- Open: **O1** GraphML attribute shape (read the visualiser's parser) · **O2** logRecord sink/transport
  config — **does not gate M21**, only M21.6 and M18.2 · **O3** tab vs dockable split · **O4** very large
  topologies (elision/clustering) — defer until a real graph hurts.

## M22 · Topology view usability — ◧ 36 of 41 SHIPPED (archived; 5 open)
_The shipped 36 (and 2 superseded) are in **[completed/tracker.md](completed/tracker.md)**.
Open: **22.3** PNG export · **22.6** alternative layouts · **22.11** re-dispatch cause (needs
`UP-FLX-10`, see `docs/proposals/upstream-asks.md`) · **22.19** partial (chips deliberately
not built) · **22.20** `.push()` targets render as orphans._
- [M22.3] ☐ **Export the view as PNG** — reuses the offscreen render already used to verify the canvas;
  pairs with the existing graph/record exports.
- [M22.6] ☐ **Alternative layouts** — the largest item. `LayeredLayout` is Sugiyama; candidates are
  breadthfirst-from-entry and a compact/orthogonal variant. Keep `TopologyLayout` as the output contract
  so the canvas is unchanged.
- [M22.11] ☐ **Re-dispatch (`processReentrantEvent`) — show the cause.** A node can raise an event on its
  own graph. Measured against generated code and a real fixture: `afterEvent()` publishes the audit record
  **before** `dispatchQueuedCallbacks()` runs, so a re-dispatch is **not** extra rows on the causing
  cycle — it is a **separate `eventLogRecord`**, same thread, normal `eventTime` (an exported call is
  stamped `-1`), carrying nothing that says it came from inside. The graphml is no help either: the raised
  event is an ordinary EVENT node with no edge from the node that raises it. So linking effect to cause
  needs the **processor source** (which node calls `processReentrantEvent`/`processAsNewEventCycle` with
  which type) plus record adjacency. Without source, claim nothing. Fixture: `riskMonitor` →
  `RiskBreachEvent` → `breachHandler` in `demo-quote-audit.yaml`, pinned by two tests.
- [M22.19] ◐ **Step-through header, playground-style** — header (`event 8 / 10 · step 2 / 5`), whole-record
  skip (`◀◀`/`▶▶`) and autoplay shipped; autoplay drives the same `stepBy(1)` path as ↓ and stops at the
  end of the log rather than sitting on the last row. The compact wording is deliberately terse: the full
  regime-aware form ("row 2 / 5 (logged nodes)") stays in the status line, because two differently-worded
  claims about the same position is how the regime distinction gets lost.
  **Event-kind chips NOT built, on purpose:** the app already has an event-type filter (the panel M22.17
  just made collapsible). A second one in the topology tab would be a second source of truth for which
  records are in scope — the exact failure `spec-graph-replay` §6 rules out for record selection. If chips
  are wanted, they should *render* the existing `FilterState`, not hold their own.

- [M22.20] ☐ **A DataFlow `.push()` target renders as an orphan.** *Measured 2026-08-17 against a probe
  graph compiled for the GraphML investigation (`docs/proposals/upstream-asks.md` §2c), fixture
  `src/test/resources/topology/push-probe.graphml`, current behaviour pinned by `PushChainTest`.*
  A `.push(target::setter)` materialises as a chain of three framework nodes —
  `rawFeed → nodeToFlowFunction_8 → mapRef2RefFlowFunction_9 → pushFlowFunction_10 → pushTarget` — all of
  class `com.telamin.fluxtion.runtime.flowfunction.function.*`, which **matches `Scaffolding`'s framework
  package prefix**. So with scaffolding hidden (**the default**) all four edges drop and `pushTarget`
  survives as an authored node with **zero edges**: a disconnected box with no explanation, the
  `rawFeed → pushTarget` relationship gone. With scaffolding shown it reads as four ordinary edges through
  three plumbing nodes — implying a propagating chain, when `.push()` is *defined* by downstream not
  seeing the effect (framework reference `docs/claude.txt`). Neither view is correct.
  **The honest fix needs `UP-FLX-28` + `UP-FLX-29` together** (marking *and* identification — with only
  the second, hiding the plumbing is what deletes the relationship).
  **Available now, without upstream:** stop orphaning silently. The status line should say *N nodes are
  connected only through hidden scaffolding* — the same move M27 already makes for a cycle that ran
  through nodes the current context cannot show. Do that first.
  **Deliberately NOT proposed:** synthesising a direct `rawFeed → pushTarget` edge by recognising
  `PushFlowFunction` by class name. It would draw the right picture by exactly the name-matching
  fragility `UP-FLX-29` exists to remove, and a wrong-but-confident edge is worse here than an honest
  gap. Revisit only if the owner rules the upstream attributes out.

## M29 · External series — ◧ SHIPPED 2026-08-18 (archived; M29.5 optional embed open)
_M29.1–.4 shipped, reviewed and merged — full record in **[completed/tracker.md](completed/tracker.md)**.
Design: **[completed/spec-external-series.md](completed/spec-external-series.md)**._
- [M29.5] ☐ *(optional, owner decides)* **`embed: true`** — carry small series inside the saved graph
  for fully-portable sharing (D-F5's alternative).

## M31 · Log-source plugins — ◧ SHIPPED 2026-08-18 (archived; example reader is cross-repo)
_31.1–.3 + the plugin-author guide shipped, reviewed and merged — full record in
**[completed/tracker.md](completed/tracker.md)**. Design: **[completed/spec-log-source-plugins.md](completed/spec-log-source-plugins.md)**._
- [M31.4r] ☐ **Out-of-tree example reader** — lives in the playground repo (this repo cannot ship it);
  also the ONE M31 acceptance only a real jar can settle (two conflicting plugin jars coexisting).
  The in-tree toy reader in ReaderSpiTest is the seam proof meanwhile. Cross-repo slice.
- [M31.5] ☐ **NOT YET** _(owner, 2026-08-27)_ · **Separate `analyser-reader-spi` artifact** — needs a multi-module
  build; deferred in review (D9). Plugin authors compile against the fatjar meanwhile.

## M33 · Investigation reports — ◧ CORE SHIPPED 2026-08-20 (archived; M33.5 gated)
_M33.1–.4 shipped, twice-reviewed, owner-eyeballed and merged — full record in
**[completed/tracker.md](completed/tracker.md)**.
Design: **[completed/spec-investigation-reports.md](completed/spec-investigation-reports.md)**._
- [M33.5] ☐ **Fold M12.1's fix-brief onto the model** (D-I6) — after the closed-loop precondition
  (journal ↔ audit-log pairing) resolves, not before. The brief inherits D-I3a for free when it lands.
- [M33.6] ☐ **YES — build it** _(owner, 2026-08-27; support are non-agent users and the CSV source is
  otherwise verb-only)_ · **chooser dialog for external marker CSVs** —
  markers are verb-first by design; *File ▸ Add series from CSV…* covers series only. Decide whether
  markers deserve the same dialog before advertising the CSV source to non-agent users.

## M35 · Log + graph lifecycle — ☑ SHIPPED 2026-08-25, all eleven slices + §E (archived)
_Everything in [completed/tracker.md](completed/tracker.md) ▸ M35. Nothing open._

## M36 · Start page — follow-up (.1–.5 SHIPPED 2026-08-25; the milestone is in completed/tracker.md, design **[completed/spec-start-page.md](completed/spec-start-page.md)**)
### Rule 1 — owner decisions (raised M36, sharpened by the polish round; the two resolved ones are archived with M36)
- ☐ **Ask upstream whether the compiler still emits that header** — every generated processor in every
  user's repo carries it. An upstream ask, not an analyser one.

## M38 · Portable context — follow-up (M38.1–.7 shipped 2026-08-27; the milestone is in completed/tracker.md, design **[completed/spec-portable-context.md](completed/spec-portable-context.md)**)
- [M38.8] ➜ **ABSORBED BY M43.2** _(owner, 2026-08-28: "the skills binding to playbook at the same time")_.
  The menu is the first surface that must ASK for a description, so shipping the storage separately would
  add an entry point needing immediate revision. Spec: **[completed/spec-ai-menu.md](completed/spec-ai-menu.md)** ▸ D-AI5.
  Original note follows — a
  runbook pointer is skill-shaped in storage but not in discovery: a model must open every file to know which
  is relevant. Add optional `runbook.N.description` (inert, gated like the name), serve it in
  `context.runbooks[]`, show it on the Project-panel row. The file-shape convention (frontmatter `name`/
  `description`, so a pointer may target a `SKILL.md`) is documented ahead of it, so no runbook needs
  rewriting. Content delivery stays as it is: the analyser serves the pointer, never the instructions.

## M43 · The AI menu — follow-up (COMPLETE 2026-08-28; the milestone is in completed/tracker.md, design **[completed/spec-ai-menu.md](completed/spec-ai-menu.md)**)
- ☐ **Owner question: the menu's name** — shipped as `AI` (proposed over *AI assistant*, since "assistant" names the
  in-app panel and the docs nav settled on *Working with AI*). Rename is a one-line change if the owner prefers otherwise.
- ☐ **D-AI9 wording addendum (owner's call, from the `c4d1db3` review)** — the light's reclaim is a POLICY: when the
  window owning the endpoint closes, the survivor re-publishes and an AI client mid-session silently reaches the
  survivor's log, where a person sees the light change. Both reviewers judge it the right policy (a dead endpoint hides
  the same change behind a hard failure); the spec should name the residual, not only the choice. One line in
  `completed/spec-ai-menu.md` ▸ D-AI9; no code.

## M39 · Baselines — "is this normal here?" — ☐ SPEC'D 2026-08-27 (owner decision 4; spec **[spec-baselines.md](spec-baselines.md)**)
- [M39] ☐ **Baselines** — ☑ **SPEC'D 2026-08-27**, `spec-baselines.md`. "Is this normal here?" — the
  question support cannot answer about a system they did not build, and the one a deterministic record
  uniquely can. Five decisions, the load-bearing two: **D-N1** a baseline is a NAMED REFERENCE RUN, never
  an abstract "normal" (an abstract normal is unfalsifiable authority — nobody can check it, and when it
  disagrees with reality there is no way to tell which is wrong); **D-N3** a comparison prints TWO
  measurements and no verdict, because a scoring tool becomes a tool people ignore after its first false
  alarm. Keyed per environment (M38.3), offered never automatic (M35–M37 spent three milestones removing
  things that fire at load), and it carries no log data. Slices M39.1–.5; four open questions for the
  owner, the first being where a baseline lives.

## M40 · Audit readiness — follow-up (.1/.2a/.2b/.3 COMPLETE 2026-08-27; the milestone is in completed/tracker.md; post-merge review `docs/handoff/completed/review_main_m40_2b_3.txt`)
- [M40.2c] ☐ **Follow the supertype chain** _(optional)_ — a node extending a project-local base that itself extends
  `EventLogNode` currently lands in UNKNOWN and stays counted. Correct but conservative; resolving one more hop needs
  the file's imports (`EventProcessorModel.resolveSimpleType`).

## M41 · One-command install — ☒ **WITHDRAWN 2026-08-27** (owner: "we use jbang, it just works")
_Spec'd the same day as a `jpackage`/Homebrew/`--print-mcp-config` milestone and withdrawn before it started. The
premise was wrong: `jbang app install analyser@telaminai/fluxtionauditlog-analyser` IS the one-command install (JBang
fetches a JDK itself), `~/.jbang/bin/analyser` is the stable launcher path the MCP recipe already uses, and `--rest`
already turns the transport on without editing `config`. Native bundles would have added a Dock icon and a signing
bill. Recorded under Decisions so it is not re-raised; reopen only when a user who cannot run JBang actually appears._

## M34 · Source adapters — ◧ **.0–.3 MERGED to main 2026-08-25** (format spec + conformance suite published); .4/.5 open
_Design: **[spec-source-adapters.md](spec-source-adapters.md)**. Owner ask: make the app general
purpose by identifying the Fluxtion-specific elements and making them plugins — then write adapters
that transform LangGraph/Temporal runs into the audit-log format and get the whole toolset for free.
The model is not Fluxtion-shaped: *an ordered sequence of cycles, each triggered by an event, each
recording which components ran in what order and what each logged, with a static graph alongside*.
M31 made CONTAINERS pluggable; M34 makes the **engine** pluggable._

_**The asymmetry is the finding, and it is a first-class decision.** The audit log generalises cleanly;
the topology does not. Some engines can hand over a **declared** graph (LangGraph); others only what
was **observed** (Temporal has no static workflow structure — but has native replay, which fits
replay-diff better than Fluxtion does). **Coverage is "declared minus observed"** — with no declared
set there is nothing to subtract from, so the feature that found the POC's 54 dead nodes cannot exist
on such a source. D-A1: adapters declare what they can supply and the core degrades LOUDLY per
capability; inferring a declaration from observed history is rejected because it always reports 100%.
D-A2: a graph is DECLARED or INFERRED and the view says which. D-A5 is the real test — GraphML moves
out of the core and becomes what the Fluxtion adapter uses, because an SPI its own built-in cannot use
is decoration. D-A6: publish the format openly and hold the NAME; the defensibility was never the
schema — it is the reference tool and the disciplines in it._

_**Review amendments (v2):** the spec generalised the record and the graph but **not the ORDER** —
and `nodeLogs` order IS dispatch order in Fluxtion, consumed as meaning by step-through, route
escalation and the M21 classification. LangGraph super-steps, Temporal activities and OTel spans
are concurrent, so an adapter would have to INVENT a total order with nothing on screen marking it
as invented. **D-A1a** adds `ordering: TOTAL | PARTIAL` plus a per-cycle concurrency marker, and
consumers qualify loudly — UP-FLX-11's lesson one level up. **D-A3** gains the attribution rule (a
value appears under a component only if that component produced or changed it — a LangGraph state
channel is SHARED, and broadcasting it would make series into cross-component duplicates that
still "work"). **D-A6**'s fixtures pin SEMANTICS not layout. Graph provenance moved onto the
returned `SourceGraph` because availability is per SOURCE, not per adapter._
- [M34.0] ☑ **The LangGraph spike, against CURRENT code** — **DONE 2026-08-20, the gate OPENS**
  (`docs/handoff/completed/report_m34_0_spike.txt`, code `tools/spikes/m34-langgraph/`). Every verb worked on a
  LangGraph run with zero analyser changes: 720 records, series/crossings/aggregate/read/coverage/
  topology/graph all live. **Two findings change M34.1.** (a) D-A1a is now OBSERVED, not inferred:
  *all 720* records contain a concurrent super-step, and step-through walks them in stream-arrival
  order while the topology paints dispatch badges — identical presentation to a Fluxtion log, where
  the same badges are meaning. Ordering moves from amendment to **precondition**. (b) coverage's
  figures were right and its reading was false — `__start__`/`__end__` counted as uncovered, so the
  declared graph needs a **structural/scaffolding flag** or an adapter must not emit pseudo-nodes.
  D-A3 needs nothing: LangGraph's per-task `result` IS the attribution rule. And the analyser caught
  the translator's invented node unprompted (`loggedButNotInTopology`), declaring every other figure
  suspect — the honesty disciplines transfer to a foreign source unmodified.
- [M34.1] ☑ **`RunAdapter` SPI** *(MERGED to main 2026-08-25)* — _ordering slice DONE 2026-08-22_: `Capabilities` gained
  `Ordering {TOTAL|PARTIAL}` **additively** (the 3-arg constructor kept — it is a published surface
  since 1.5.0, and TOTAL is correct for every container that existed then); the claim is carried to
  `LogIndex.totalOrder()` beside `byteAnchors`, reported by `context` before anything is derived from
  position, and marked in Settings ▸ Plugins. Native path verified unchanged in the running jar.
  **Second slice, 2026-08-25:** `graph(Path)` added as a DEFAULT returning empty (published surface
  since 1.5.0 — every existing reader keeps compiling); `SourceGraph {nodes, edges, provenance}` in
  the core's own vocabulary, with provenance riding the RETURNED graph because availability is per
  SOURCE (review F4). Reconciliation settled as **`GraphSource`**, which is M35.3's asymmetry one
  level out: a graph someone OPENED is intent and wins; one an adapter SUPPLIED is convenience and
  yields. `coverage` now REFUSES on an INFERRED graph rather than printing the 100% it gets by
  construction — the M34.0 spike's §4 finding turned into a guard.
- [M34.2] ☑ **Capability degradation wired** — _ordering half DONE 2026-08-25 on
  `feat/m34-adapters`_: the ordinal badge is not painted on a PARTIAL source, step-through says
  "logged N / M" not "step N / M", the Topology status carries a standing warning, and the echo
  carries `orderMeaningful` + `orderCaveat` because an agent reads the data, not the picture.
  Verified against a real PARTIAL source — a throwaway reader plugin, which also exercised M31's
  ServiceLoader path end to end for the first time since it shipped. `coverage` already refuses an
  INFERRED graph (M34.1). **Remaining:** "did not run" shading and replay-diff, each to degrade
  loudly with its reason rather than silently.
  _**Shading half DONE 2026-08-25:** an INFERRED graph's execution categories are hollow by
  construction — every node in it ran — so the status and the `topology` echo say that an absence of
  "did not run" nodes proves nothing. **Replay-diff has nothing to degrade: the feature does not
  exist yet** (the spec names it as something Temporal's native replay would fit better than
  Fluxtion). M34.2 is therefore complete against what is built; revisit when replay-diff lands._
- [M34.3] ☑ **Format specification + conformance fixtures** (D-A6); the built-in adapter passes them.
  _DONE 2026-08-25, merged to main_ — `docs/site/format-spec.md` (Format 1, MUST/SHOULD, in the
  site nav under *The audit log*) and `src/test/resources/conformance/` (12 files) + `FormatConformanceTest`
  (14 tests): C01–C13 pin the minimal record, forward tolerance, the header, the `-1` sentinel, untimed
  records, out-of-order reporting, duplicate ids, lenient values, garbage retention, the ordering claim,
  attribution-by-position, the traced regime and exported calls. **Every fixture runs through the built-in
  text path and the SPI pass-through path, and the two must agree** — that agreement is the promise to an
  adapter author. Report: `docs/handoff/completed/report_feat_m34_conformance.txt`.
- [M34.5] ☐ **Per-cycle concurrency marker — specified in D-A1a, absent from Format 1** _(surfaced by
  writing the spec page, 2026-08-25)_ — a mostly-sequential engine cannot be honest about the cycles that
  were concurrent without declaring the whole source PARTIAL. The M34.0 spike smuggled one through a
  `nodeLogs` item and it resolved as a data series with a mangled value (report §3). Needs a real field,
  a parser change, and the badge/step logic honouring it per record. The spec page says "not in Format 1"
  until it lands; the traced-regime marker (UP-FLX-11) is the other gap it names, and is upstream.
- [M34.4] ☐ **First foreign adapter, out of tree — LangGraph**, the throwaway translator of M34.0
  rebuilt against the SPI: same engine, now a supported source rather than a hand-fed file.
- _**Sequencing.** M34.0 is the gate and nothing else starts until it reports. It and M34.4 were two
  descriptions of one idea at different costs — the earlier draft named M34.4 as "the experiment that
  decides whether the rest is worth building", which is M34.0's job now that the spike is a slice of
  its own. M34.4 is no longer an experiment: by then the question is answered and the work is
  conformance. If M34.0 says a foreign run cannot be made legible by today's tool, no SPI fixes that
  and M34.1–.4 do not begin._

## M11 · Research → monitoring promotion (Grafana) — ☐ FUTURE (vision)
_Design: **[spec-assistant-actions.md](completed/spec-assistant-actions.md) §12**. Two complementary systems: the
analyser answers **unknown, one‑off** questions (forensic, source‑linked, LLM‑assisted); Grafana answers
**known, continuous** questions (dashboards, alerting). The workflow is a **promotion pipeline** — research
a series in the analyser until it's diagnostic, then promote it to production monitoring._
- [M11.1] ☐ **`export_promotion`** (analyser authoring action / File export) — emit a **neutral
  promotion manifest** from the named saved graphs; the named `GraphSpec` is the contract, and A10.8
  built the naming/persistence it depends on. _Renamed and rescoped 2026-08-20 by the decision below:
  the analyser emits the manifest, **an agent renders the Grafana JSON**._
  Manifest contents, all exactly reproducible from the `GraphSpec`: the **series** (keys/formula,
  resolve policy, label), the **allowlist** (the precise `instanceId.key` set the tap must publish),
  **thresholds** from the graph's guides, the pinned **window**, the **rationale** (explanation +
  notes — why this is worth watching), and **provenance** (log fingerprint + analyser version, reusing
  M33's D-I3a identity data).
- _**Decision (2026-08-20) — the analyser emits a manifest; the agent renders the dashboard.** M11.1
  as originally written had the analyser learning Grafana's dashboard schema, which contradicts the
  rule M29 and M31 both settled: **the analyser never learns a foreign format — the agent adapts it.**
  If it is wrong to teach the tool FIX on the way in, it is wrong to teach it Grafana on the way out,
  and a versioned foreign schema is a permanent maintenance tax on a hermetic core.
  The two artefacts have opposite requirements, so they split along the derived/declared seam this
  codebase already uses everywhere (M33 D-I7 rows-derived/presentation-declared; M28.6
  condition-persists/intervals-are-data): the **allowlist must be deterministic and analyser-generated**
  because M11.2's tap consumes it and the bounded-cardinality guarantee only holds if it is *derived*;
  the **dashboard JSON is presentation over a foreign schema** and is agent work.
  What makes it safe is that the manifest is a **checkable contract**: every metric the generated
  dashboard references must appear in the allowlist, and every promoted series must appear as a panel —
  a mechanical round-trip. Fidelity ("the chart I validated is the chart that alerts") is preserved by
  the series definition travelling verbatim rather than being re-derived.
  Consequences: multi-target for free (Grafana, Datadog, Perses) with no schema version matrix; the
  agent contributes what the analyser cannot know — dashboard conventions, folder structure, alert
  routing; and M11.1 becomes a serialisation of state already held rather than a foreign-format
  generator. **M11.2 is unaffected** — it consumes the allowlist either way.
  **Validate before speccing the verb:** have an agent build one real Grafana dashboard from a
  hand-written manifest first. If it has to ask questions the manifest cannot answer, the manifest is
  wrong — the same spike-before-SPI logic as M34.0, for the cost of one dashboard._
- [M11.2] ☐ **Telamin‑side tap plugin** (`serverplugin-metrics` / `-grafana`, *not* an analyser feature) —
  a `LogRecordListener` metrics sink alongside the file sink, publishing selected `instanceId.key` as
  typed time‑series (Prometheus / Influx / Kafka). Route B (tap at source), **not** Loki/LogQL re‑parsing
  of raw `toString()`s (Route A rejected — re‑fights the parser battle, loses NaN/boolean/last‑occurrence
  semantics). Cardinality bounded because the graph is static.
- [M11.3] ☐ **Closed loop** — Grafana alert → open the analyser on that log+window → LLM forensics → root
  cause → maybe promote a new series. **Boundary:** the analyser stays a deep‑dive tool; it does **not**
  become a live dashboard (real‑time viz is Grafana's job — don't duplicate where there's no moat).

## Suggested delivery order

_Refreshed 2026-08-28. Shipped since the last refresh: **1.11.0** (M42 connect an AI client), then **M33.7** report
table sources and **M43** the AI menu (+ M38.8), both reviewed SOUND on main, unreleased. **M41** was spec'd and
withdrawn. Open on main: two ledger entries (`ac6a559` the status-light poll; `7e8e859` the Mongoose spec addendum)
and the M43 menu-name question for the owner._

1. **Release 1.12.0** — gates passed 2026-08-28: 1069 green, `mkdocs --strict`, sweep, ledger clear (archived to
   `handoff/completed/unreviewed-changes-2026-08.md`), eyeball CHECK C passed by the owner (ready → elsewhere in amber →
   ready in green). `[Unreleased]` carries M33.7 + M43 + three fixes.
2. **M39 baselines** — spec'd; the mixed-version hazard is built (M38.7, D-C10). Next model-level feature.
3. **The Mongoose bootstrap artefacts** (`docs/specs/mongoose-bootstrap-artefacts/`, reviewed with §10a A1–A4
   written in) — anchor to `spec-agent-brokered-dev-loop.md` and back its gates with `tools/bench/loop-bench.py`
   before filing UP-MNG-01…04.
4. **M34.4/.5** (first foreign adapter; per-cycle concurrency marker — needs the owner to name the field).
5. **M19.1a** (Mongoose starter conformance bench: D-02 then the first typed slice; no bundle claim
   before its native audit and conditional VAL-12 evidence), **M19.3/.4** (tutorial, publish-gated on
   the playground Download), and **M19.8** (bench in CI).
6. **The small schedulable remnants**, any time: **M40.2c**, **M20.5** (project artifact pointers — tier 1 of M38's
   model, share its path validation), **M29.5**, **M13.5**, **M21.7–.9**, the **M22** five
   (`docs/handoff/completed/handoff_17_aug_2026_1.txt`), **M33.5** (gated), **M33.6** (owner said YES), the M36
   rule-1 upstream ask.
7. **Cross-repo — the §H gate is MET; DRAFTED and READY TO FILE, still unfiled: UP-MNG-01…04, UP-PG-01…02,
   UP-RDR-01 in [upstream-asks.md](../proposals/upstream-asks.md) §5–§7**, **UP-MNG-03** (the server supplying the environment) has its analyser-side
   counterpart in M38.3: where both exist the declaration wins and `context.provenanceSource` says so.
8. **M12** (diagnose → fix → prove) stays active design; **M11** stays vision until a real Grafana consumer appears.

## Decisions (resolved)
- **API key at rest:** stored **cleartext** in `~/.fluxtion-analyser/config`.
- **Display time zone:** **UTC** for all date/time rendering.
- **EventProcessor:** **infer when possible** by scoring candidate processors' `instanceId→field`
  sets against the log's observed instanceIds; fall back to configured/default
  `DemoMarketMakerStrategy` (user can override). Implemented in M4 (needs source parsing).
- **Server control is not an assistant capability** (spec-closed-loop §B.5) — server verbs never
  appear on the action socket; any future agent-initiated server action requires per-action human
  approval. Keeps the FAQ's security guarantee simple and true.
- **Agent fixes arrive as evidence-linked PRs on a branch, never direct edits** (spec-closed-loop
  §A.4) — the M12 guardrail, embedded verbatim in every generated brief.
- **O5 RESOLVED (2026-08-15) — the analyser and `svc-admin-web` complement, and the overlap is
  deliberate.** The analyser is a **dev tool _and_ a production-support tool**; web-admin views **one
  live server** whose log may be rolled or deleted, and suits dev + MCP-driven poking. A low-latency
  production system may have **no admin-web and no MCP at all** — logs are transported to a shared store,
  and **offline analysis across many files is where the analyser shines**. So the topology view and event
  step-through are **replicated into the analyser** (**M21**), because the good view has to exist where
  the logs actually land. Consequence: the analyser needs the **GraphML**, sourced from a file first and
  the server only when one happens to be there.
- **Distribution is the shaded fatjar + JBang; no native bundles** _(2026-08-27)_ — `jbang app install analyser@…`
  is the one-command install (JBang supplies the JDK), `~/.jbang/bin/analyser` is a stable launcher path for MCP
  configs, `--rest` enables the transport without a config edit. A `jpackage`/Homebrew milestone (M41) was spec'd
  and withdrawn the same day: it would have added a Dock icon, a four-runner release matrix and a code-signing
  bill, and solved nothing a user has asked for. Reopen only for a real user who cannot run JBang.
- **The MCP server identity is `fluxtion-analyser`; its executable need not share that name** _(2026-08-27)_ — a
  client registration names the server independently and launches a resolved absolute command. The current JBang
  launcher remains `analyser`; M42 uses it rather than making an install-name migration a prerequisite. A compatible
  `fluxtion-analyser` JBang alias is welcome only after it has been proven to coexist and upgrade cleanly.
- **Rendering stays Swing/Java2D — no embedded browser.** Reusing the JS replay engine via JCEF/JavaFX
  WebView would cost a ~100MB native per-platform dependency and destroy the single shaded fatjar that
  `jbang analyser@…` depends on. FlatLaf remains the only runtime dependency; a hand-rolled layered
  layout is the work, with pure-Java ELK as the fallback (spec-graph-replay §3).

## Open questions

- Graph "last occurrence per record" vs "all occurrences" default. (spec: last; expose toggle.)
